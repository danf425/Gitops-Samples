# GitOps PR Pipeline with Notification  

## Overview  

Now that we have created a [PR pipeline](/Sample-2/README.md) that updates `values.yaml`, obtains approval before merging the PR, and then syncs the GitOps application with the merged changes, let's add a notification mechanism. This will send an email notification when the pipeline completes successfully.  

## Prerequisites  

Ensure you have all the [prerequisites](/Sample-2/README.md#prerequisites) before adding a notification mechanism to the GitOps PR Pipeline.  

## GitOps PR Pipeline  

Follow this guide to [create the GitOps PR Pipeline](/Sample-2/README.md#creating-a-pr-pipeline) before adding notifications.  

## Adding Notification to the GitOps Pipeline  

Once you have the [PR pipeline](/Sample-2/README.md#creating-a-pr-pipeline) ready, let's add a notification rule.  

1. In the **Pipeline Studio**, click on **Notify** and then click on **+ Notifications**.

2. Under **Overview**, give your notification a name.

3. Under **Pipeline Events**, select **Pipeline Success** to trigger a notification when the pipeline completes successfully.

4. Under **Notification Method**, choose **Email** as the Channel Type. Harness supports other Channel Types such as Microsoft Teams, Slack, PagerDuty, and Webhooks.

5. Under **Type emails of your recipients**, add the email addresses or select user groups that should receive the notification. Individual users within a user group will receive the same notification.

6. Click **Finish** to apply the notification method.

You have successfully set up a notification rule to receive alerts when your GitOps PR pipeline completes! ðŸš€
