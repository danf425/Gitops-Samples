# GitOps Sample  

This repository contains various **GitOps Sample Pipelines** using **Harness GitOps** to help you automate deployments, sync applications, and handle failure scenarios efficiently. These samples cover different aspects of GitOps workflows, including syncing applications, automating PR-based deployments, handling failures, integrating security testing, and setting up notifications for pipeline completion.

## üöÄ Samples Covered  

Below are the different GitOps workflows covered in this repository:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ [Fetching App Details and Syncing App using Harness Pipeline](https://github.com/harness-community/Gitops-Samples/tree/gitops-1/Fetch-App-Sync)  
Learn how to create a **Harness GitOps pipeline** that fetches application details and syncs it with the desired state defined in Git. 
This sample covers:  
‚úî Setting up a **GitOps pipeline** in Harness  
‚úî Fetching application details from the Git repository  
‚úî Syncing the application using Harness GitOps  

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ [PR Pipeline: Update Values, Approve, Merge & Sync GitOps App](https://github.com/harness-community/Gitops-Samples/tree/main/PR-Pipeline)  
This sample demonstrates a **PR-based GitOps pipeline**, where application updates go through a **Pull Request (PR) workflow** before being deployed. 
Key highlights:  
‚úî Updating `values.yaml` in a GitOps repository  
‚úî Raising a **PR to review changes** before deployment  
‚úî Obtaining **manual approval** before merging  
‚úî Merging the PR and **syncing the GitOps application**  

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ [GitOps PR Pipeline with Failure Strategy](https://github.com/harness-community/Gitops-Samples/tree/main/Failure-Strategy-PR-Pipeline)  
This sample builds on the PR pipeline by adding a **Failure Strategy** to ensure the application remains in a **healthy state** in case of sync failures.  
‚úî If **GitOps sync fails**, the pipeline will **revert the merged PR**  
‚úî This restores the application to a **previous healthy state**  
‚úî After reverting, the pipeline **re-syncs** the GitOps application  

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ [Adding Notifications to the GitOps PR Pipeline](https://github.com/harness-community/Gitops-Samples/tree/main/Notifications-PR-Pipeline)  
This sample focuses on **adding notifications** to a GitOps PR pipeline. It ensures that users are informed when a pipeline completes successfully.  
‚úî Configuring **email notifications**  
‚úî Selecting **pipeline events** to trigger notifications  
‚úî Adding **recipients and user groups**  

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ [PR Pipeline with Security Testing Orchestration (STO) and Rollback](https://github.com/harness-community/Gitops-Samples/tree/main/PR-Pipeline-STO)
This sample extends the PR Pipeline by integrating Security Testing Orchestration (STO) to scan for vulnerabilities before deploying changes.

‚úî **Aqua Trivy** for scanning container images for security vulnerabilities

‚úî **Gitleaks** for detecting secrets and vulnerabilities in the Git repository

‚úî Failure Strategy to rollback changes if high-severity vulnerabilities are found

‚úî Ensures that only **secure deployments** make it to production

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ [Syncing Multiple GitOps Applications](https://github.com/harness-community/Gitops-Samples/tree/main/Syncing-multiple-apps)
This sample demonstrates how to **sync multiple GitOps applications** in Harness GitOps pipelines.

‚úî Manually select multiple applications for syncing in Harness pipelines.

‚úî Use a **matrix looping strategy** to dynamically sync multiple applications at runtime.

‚úî Improve efficiency by syncing multiple applications in a single pipeline execution.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ [ Deploying to a New Environment Using ApplicationSet in PR Pipeline](https://github.com/harness-community/Gitops-Samples/tree/main/Application-Set)

This sample demonstrates how to deploy an application to a new environment using **ApplicationSet in a PR Pipeline**.

‚úî Uses ApplicationSet to dynamically generate applications for new environments.

‚úî Automatically detects environment configurations in the repo and provisions applications.

‚úî PR pipeline workflow includes creating a **config file, approval, merge, and syncing ApplicationSet**.

‚úî Git Generator fetches environment details from `config.json` for automation.

‚úî Streamlines deployments across multiple environments using a GitOps-driven workflow.
